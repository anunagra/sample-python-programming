# Basics of Programming, Using Python

## Overview
In this course we will provide an introduction to important programming concepts like functions, classes and data structures. Software engineers at companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo! use these programming ideas on a daily basis and therefore a firm grasp of these ideas is important to learn and master programing.

We will use a programming language called Python to write all our code. Python is one of the most popular coding languages in the world and reads like English in many instances; thus it an excellent choice for our student, who is in the early stages of their programming journey.

Now we recognize that learning to program can be an intimidating task for many. We ourselves remember how difficult it was for us to learn when we were first getting started. So we will take things slow and unpack several important programming ideas using projects that you would love to share with your friends and family. 

As you interact with this course by watching videos and answering quizzes, you will find that this course is adaptive. That means that the version of the course you see is unique and custom created for you. As we learn more about your learning preferences and programming proficiency we will create a unique learning path to serve your needs. 

## Duration
We anticipate that the learner will spend between 25-30 hours to finish this course and its projects.

## Pre-requisites
We require that the learner has a basic understanding of programming before taking this course. This means that the learner should be familiar with the following ideas in any programming language:
- P1: Variables
- P2: If statements
- P3: Loops like For/While
- P4: Boolean operators

> P1 = Prerequisite 1

We also require that the student have access to a computer with a browser and internet connection. The student should also demonstrate a willingness to learn something new.


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, students will be able to:
- LO0 - (Prerequisites) Display knowledge of variables, if statements, loops in any programming language.
- LO1: Demonstrate how to use programming ideas like functions and classes while building multiple Python projects
- LO2: Showcase how to implement data structures like Lists and Dictionaries in Python 
- LO3: Use Python documentation to debug errors 
- LO4: Implement built-in Python functions and classes to reuse code

> LO1 = Learning Objective 1

- Windows
- Mac
- Mobile
- All (default; in case the tag is missing from an instructional material. we will assume that the instructional material shows up for all devices)

#### Advanced
Identifies if an instructional material should be displayed to Advanced students, or all students. Deshbir and Kunal and working to identify what parameters qualify as an advanced student
- True
- False (default)

#### Social
Labels if the instructional material requires the student to talk to other students in the class.
- True
- False (default)

## Instructor

**Kunal Chawla**

After obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Texas at Austin, Kunal worked as a programmer for three years, but then decided to switch gears to education. He taught middle school science, worked with Google on a distance learning initiative, and eventually earned a Master’s degree in educational technology from Stanford University. He has also created a few online courses with Udacity that have been taken by several hundred thousand students.
